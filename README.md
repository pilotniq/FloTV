Controls two LED channels on an ATTiny85 microcontroller lighting up a Diophane.

## Installation of Development Tools

Install the Arduino development environment from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Follow the instructions to install the ATTiny Board package [here](http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting).

Sometimes flashing the code to the board fails. Unplugging and plugging in the board to the computer can help.
